This was a project done for my ICS4U class where we were given the task to create an application or software for an actual client. My project partner and I worked with our school's vice principal to create a program to aid him with managing on call teachers.


# How It Works
Our program contains a database of all the teachers at our school, along with their class schedules.

The main function of this program is to be able to input the name of an absent teacher, the period they absent for and the date they will be absent which will be read by the program. The program will then quickly receives the schedule of that teacher and bring up a short list of teachers who are able to fill in for them for that day and period.
